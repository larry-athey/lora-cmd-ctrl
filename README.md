# LoRa+CMD+CTRL
**aka: LCC** - Remote command and control system based on Raspberry Pi (or clone), ESP32, and RYLR998 LoRa wireless modems. Can be used for any kind of automation that requires remote switching, motor direction and speed control, position/location tracking, and scripting. Also works great for model railroad control.
